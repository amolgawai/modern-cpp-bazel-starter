#+TITLE: Modern C++ Practice
#+AUTHOR: Amol Gawai
#+STARTUP: Overview
* Introduction
This is a starter template for a multi lib, multi app project born out of my needs.
This template is based on starter project [[https://github.com/TheLartians/ModernCppStarter][ModernCppStarter]], the cmake is loosly based on [[https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/][Introduction to Modern CMake]] and some cmake modules from [[https://github.com/bsamseth/cpp-project][cpp-project boilerplate]].
See [[file:README_Original.md][ModernCppStarter README for more details about originating concepts]].
* Guiding Principles
** Repository Structure
- As far as possible, all directories are self contained
- Executables are in the "apps" directory, one directory per app
- Libraries are in "libs" directory, one directory per library
- Every app or library directory has one or all of directories viz. "include", "src", "tests"
- Each namespace gets own directory inside the above three
** Build System
- CMake is primary build system(version 3.23), Bazel might be added later
- Out of source build and dependency management
- Every target (executable or library) CMakeLists.txt is self contained (i.e. does not depend directly on the external structure)
- The main CMakeLists.txt makes all the dependencies available to the apps and libraries
- [[https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake][CPM]] is used for external dependency download and setup
* How to use this template
1. Use the "Use this template" button on github to create a new repository with all the content of this starter, modify according to your needs.
2. Clone this repo locally and remove/change the remote

* Building with CMake
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # configure build with ninja
   cmake -S . -B build -GNinja
  # build everything
   cmake --build build
  # build specific target
   cmake --build build --target <name>
  # configure with code quality tools namely sanitizers, cppcheck, include what you use (iwyu), codecoverage
   cmake -S . -B build -GNinja -DUSE_SANITIZER='Memory;MemoryWithOrigins;Thread;Leak;Address;Undefined' -DUSE_STATIC_ANALYZER='clang-tidy;iwyu;cppcheck' -DENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Coverage
  # run codecoverage for tests (e.g. greeter tests)
   cmake --build build --target coverage_greeter
  # open the code coverage report
   open build/coverage_out/index.html
#+END_SRC
